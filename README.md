# Quark - the editor the world doesn't need

Quark is an editor written in Haskell as a learning project by an author that wanted something more useful than nano, but did not want to invest the time needed to learn emacs or vim (preferring to use fully fledged IDEs for large projects anyway). It is slightly inspired by [Atom](https://atom.io), hence the name (in other words quark as in the elementary particle, not the dairy product), as well as a few other editors and IDEs.

Though it now satisfies most of the author's everyday needs, it is still in pre-alpha and has only been tested in xfce4-terminal 0.8.4 (it might work in other xterm-256color environments as well). There are also a few kinks and quirks and, unfortunately, the source code is the documentation for now. Nevertheless, feel free to try it out, contribute, report bugs and/or request functionality.
