Functionality:
  - Show overflow hints (~)
  - indicate 80 column width
  - better handle terminal resize
  - python lexer
  - zsh lexer
  - tab completion/hints for file open

Code structure:
  - type ExtendedBuffer = (Buffer, BufferMetaData)
    type BufferMetaData = (FilePath, Language, Protected)
      - guess language from path
      - absolute FilePath

Possible functional or stylistic improvements:
  - Make Flipper foldable and traversable
  - Adapt colors to various terminal environments
  - Use State monad with Layout to track, for example, insert mode, project root
